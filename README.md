# Welcome to the MainlineMusic Temporary Store!

This is the source codr for the temporary mainline music store while I make a custom solution in next.

 ## About this project
 
This is a forked version of the [Fresh "Merch" demo](https://github.com/denoland/merch), with a couple name changes. This repo is then deployed globally acrosss 30+ servers with deno deploy. The products are hosted in a Shopify store, and are querried at runtime with the Shopify API.
